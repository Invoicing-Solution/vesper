# Vesper - Middleware for AWS Lambda

## What's in a name?

Golang has a rich history of naming HTTP and middleware type libraries on classy gin-based beverages (think Gin, Martini and Negroni). Vesper is yet another gin-based beverage.

Vesper was also inspired by [Middy JS](https://github.com/middyjs/middy), who's mascot is a Moped.

Vesper is a (not so clever) _portmanteau_ of Vesper, the gin-based martini, and Vespa, a beautiful Italian scooter.
